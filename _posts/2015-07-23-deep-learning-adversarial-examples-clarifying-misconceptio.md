    description: "Linear regression is one of the first things you should try if you're modeling a linear relationship (actually, non-linear relationships too!). It's fairly simple, and probably the first thing to learn when tackling machine learning. At first, linear regression shows up just as a simple equation for a line."

    description: Real-time detection and classification of signals or events present in time series data is a fairly common need. Stereotypical examples include identifying high-risk conditions in ICU data streams or classifying signals present in acoustic data from diagnostic or monitoring sensors. Using a combination of stream processing and machine learning is an agile and highly capable approach.

    description: "Volume is the most prominent of big data's \"3 Vs.\" Yet, the \"big\" in big data analysis is often a misnomer. Most big data analysis doesn't look at a complete, large dataset. Instead, it looks at a subsample and works on approximations, which prevents enterprises from getting the most valuable insight from their data."
